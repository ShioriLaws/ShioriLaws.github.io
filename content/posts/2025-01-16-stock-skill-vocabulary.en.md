## The Inspiration

I watched a YouTube video by Charlie Tran about "going from zero jazz piano skills to gigging in 2 years."

{{< youtube RiCQYWPEhjc >}}

His approach is called "Stock Skill Vocabulary"—a method of systematically breaking down jazz piano skills and accumulating them as vocabulary.

This has similarities to Sean Wilson's approach, whom I've been watching on YouTube lately. He says everyone wants to learn tensions, but you need to understand basic triad progressions first. Even long-time intermediate players have areas with learning gaps, according to him.

## Why Vocabulary?

A common mistake when learning jazz piano is learning "tensions" first.

But in reality, **if you don't understand chord progressions with triads, you can't add tensions on the fly**.

Like language learning, it's most efficient to gradually build basic grammar (triad progressions) and vocabulary (various voicings, licks).

## The 4 Categories of Stock Skill Vocabulary

Charlie Tran categorizes jazz piano skills into four areas:

### 1. Melody

**General Piano Clichés:**
- Chromaticism
- Arpeggios
- Scales (major & minor)

**Jazz-specific Clichés:**
- Melodic clichés (stock of jazz-like phrases)
- Analyzing melodies of existing songs to extract patterns

### 2. Bass

**Walking Bass:**
- Triads, scalar approaches
- Roots, 5ths, chromatic approaches

**Half Note Bass:**
- Roots, 5ths, chromatic approaches

### 3. Voicing

**One-hand Voicings:**
- Rooted voicing (includes root)
- Bass Shells
  - 2-note: Bass + 1 Essential Tone (e.g., I + VII)
  - 3-note: Bass + 2 Essential Tones (e.g., I + III + VII)
- Rootless voicing (omitting root)
- Inversions Type A, B, C

**Two-hand Voicings:**
- Open voicing
  - 4-note, 5-note, 6-note stocks
- Closed Voicing
  - Block chords
  - Drop 2
- Spread voicing (Melody-driven Open voicing)
  - Functional level (no extensions)
  - Authentic (with tensions)
  - Pro (with altered notes)

The key point is that everything boils down to **Shells → Essential Tones**.

### 4. Rhythm

**Comping Patterns:**
- Red Garland style
- Charleston
- Reverse Charleston

**Swing Rhythm:**
- Rhythmic patterns with swing feel

## Practice: 4 Stock Styles

Four basic styles for applying learned vocabulary:

1. **RH: Melody, LH: Bass**
   - Right hand plays melody, left hand plays bass line
2. **RH: Melody, LH: Comping**
   - Right hand plays melody, left hand comps chords
3. **RH: Comping, LH: Bass**
   - Right hand comps chords, left hand plays bass line
4. **Spread Voicing**
   - Two-handed melody-driven open voicing

### Advanced Styles

- **Two-handed comping** - Comping with both hands
- **Block Chord Melody** - Melody with continuous chord accompaniment
- **3 Part Bossa** - Right hand plays melody + comping in different rhythm, left hand plays bass

## Connecting to My Own Learning

This approach connects to my previous work transcribing "Encourage Yourself."

Transcription work helps build such vocabulary. Specifically:
- Subtle nuances of vocal runs → Stock of melodic clichés
- Skills to insert cool licks while keeping note density low → Stock of voicings

The "Stacking" (doubling notes within a voicing) and "Extensions" that Sean Wilson talks about also fall under the "Voicing" category in this Stock Skill Vocabulary framework.

## Summary

Jazz piano improvement isn't about practicing aimlessly:

1. **Break skills into 4 categories** (Melody, Bass, Voicing, Rhythm)
2. **Systematically build vocabulary in each category**
3. **Practice with 4 Stock Styles**

This approach seems effective.

I still need to expand my vocabulary, but I feel like I now have a clear roadmap.

Right now I'm practicing and transcribing randomly, but I want to create a menu and plan that balances all four categories.
