## What This Blog Is About

I'm embracing the "Learning in Public" philosophy—documenting my learning journey as I go, mistakes and all.

Here's what I'll be writing about:
- Music (piano, vocals, songwriting, gospel, production)
- Knowledge Management
- Vibe Coding / Working with AI agents
- Life optimization (cooking, household systems, etc.)
- Whatever else I'm figuring out

My workflow: I take notes in Obsidian, polish them up with AI assistance, and publish them here.

Thanks for following along!
