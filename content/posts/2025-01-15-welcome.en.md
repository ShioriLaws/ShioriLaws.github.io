## About This Blog

This is a blog where I share my daily learning journey, following the "Learning in Public" concept.

Main topics:
- Music (piano, singing, songwriting, gospel, music production)
- Knowledge Management
- Vibe Coding / Collaboration with Agentic AI
- Home Management (improving how I do housework, cooking, etc.)
- Other learnings

I'll be organizing and refining my learning notes recorded in Obsidian with the help of AI, then publishing them here.

Looking forward to sharing this journey with you!
