## Where This Came From

I stumbled on a YouTube video by Charlie Tran where he breaks down how he went from zero jazz piano skills to gigging in just two years.

His method is called "Stock Skill Vocabulary"—basically, treating jazz piano like a language where you systematically build up a library of musical phrases and patterns.

This resonates with what I've been hearing from Sean Wilson (another YouTuber I've been following). His point: everyone wants to jump straight to tensions and fancy extensions, but if you can't nail basic triad progressions, you're building on sand. Even longtime intermediate players often have blind spots in the fundamentals.

## Why "Vocabulary"?

Here's the trap: you learn a bunch of cool tensions and altered chords, but when you try to use them in real time, you freeze. Why? Because **you can't decorate a house you haven't built yet.**

If triads and basic progressions aren't automatic, adding tensions on the fly is hopeless.

Think of it like learning a language. You need grammar (how progressions work) *and* vocabulary (specific voicings, licks, patterns). Build both systematically.

## The Four Categories

Charlie breaks jazz piano skills into four buckets:

### 1. Melody

**General piano stuff:**
- Chromaticism
- Arpeggios
- Major and minor scales

**Jazz-specific:**
- Stock melodic phrases (the "licks" everyone talks about)
- Extracting patterns from tunes you transcribe

### 2. Bass

**Walking bass:**
- Triadic and scalar movement
- Root, fifth, chromatic approach notes

**Half-note bass:**
- Same toolkit, slower rhythm

### 3. Voicing

**One hand:**
- Rooted voicings
- Shell voicings (2-note: root + one guide tone; 3-note: root + two guide tones)
- Rootless voicings
- Inversions (Type A, B, C)

**Two hands:**
- Open voicings (4-, 5-, 6-note)
- Closed voicings (block chords, drop 2)
- Spread voicings (melody-driven, open)—this is Charlie's own categorization from his curriculum:
  - Functional (no extensions)
  - Authentic (with tensions)
  - Pro (with alterations)

The throughline: **start with shells, add essential tones, expand from there.**

### 4. Rhythm

**Comping patterns:**
- Red Garland style
- Charleston
- Reverse Charleston

**Swing feel:**
- Internalizing that triplet-based groove

## Putting It Together: 4 Stock Styles

Once you've got vocabulary in each category, you combine them:

1. **RH melody + LH bass** — classic solo piano texture
2. **RH melody + LH comping** — melody over chord stabs
3. **RH comping + LH bass** — accompaniment mode
4. **Spread voicing** — two-handed, melody-driven open voicings

**Advanced styles:**
- Two-handed comping
- Block chord melody (locked hands)
- 3-part bossa (RH does melody + comping in different rhythms, LH walks bass)

## How This Connects to My Practice

This framework clicked for me because it maps directly onto what I've been doing with transcription.

When I transcribed "Encourage Yourself," I was essentially:
- Building melodic vocabulary by catching the subtle runs
- Learning voicing vocabulary by figuring out how the arrangement stays sparse but punchy

Sean Wilson's "stacking" technique (doubling notes in a voicing) and his approach to extensions? Those slot right into the Voicing category here.

## Takeaway

Stop practicing randomly. Instead:

1. **Categorize** your skills (Melody, Bass, Voicing, Rhythm)
2. **Build vocabulary** in each area deliberately
3. **Apply** through the four stock styles

I've got a clearer roadmap now. Next step: build a practice routine that hits all four categories instead of just noodling on whatever sounds fun.
